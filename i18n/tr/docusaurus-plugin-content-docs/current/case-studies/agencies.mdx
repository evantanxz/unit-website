# Agencies

### Elevating Growth with Strategic Partnerships

As a key facet of Unit Network's growth strategy, we focus on cultivating specialized, responsible, and reputable agencies dedicated to assisting individuals, businesses, and communities in the tokenization process.

These agencies operate independently of Unit Network and the Core Team, often managing their own entities. They specialize in various industries or geographical locations, employing a hybrid approach that combines data-driven methodologies with innovative artistic elements in project design and storytelling.

By fostering these partnerships, we aim to enhance the tokenization landscape, promoting sustainable growth and facilitating the development of impactful token projects.

### Empowering Global Tokenization Services

Our agency model is designed for remote collaboration, enabling the establishment of agencies to cater to token projects on a global scale. The vision is to encourage the development of native agencies for every industry and city, facilitating the tokenization of businesses tailored to specific regions or sectors.

Agencies operate with strong incentives to support businesses in their tokenization journey, contributing to fund-raising efforts. The success of these agencies translates into revenue streams for key contributors, including early adopters and content creators across platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube. This model aims to create a mutually beneficial ecosystem, driving growth and fostering a dynamic tokenization landscape.
