# Co-operation Agreement

Empowering Innovation, Nurturing Collaboration

## Navigating Excellence in the Journey to Unit Network Contributor Membership

**Becoming a Contributor**

Unit Network, as a decentralized platform and DAO, places a high premium on collaboration, innovation, and self-sufficiency. Our commitment is to establish an environment where each contributor can flourish, acknowledging the distinct skills and perspectives that every individual brings to our community.

In fostering a strong sense of community and ensuring equitable treatment for all contributors, we have introduced the Contributor Cooperation Agreement. This agreement serves as a guide, outlining the expectations and responsibilities that all contributors, aspiring to become Unit Team members, must embrace within the Unit Network ecosystem.

**Key Elements of the Cooperation Agreement:**

1.                   Duties:

    All contributors are expected to actively contribute to the ecosystem's growth, engaging in tasks like developing initiatives, creating content, providing feedback, and participating in community events.

2.                   Core Values:

    Proper attribution of contributions to individual contributors is mandatory. This ensures due recognition for their work and facilitates others in building upon these contributions.

3.                   Licensing:

    All contributions must be made under an open-source license. This commitment ensures that the wider community can benefit from contributions, fostering an open and transparent ecosystem.

4.                   Conflict Resolution:

    In cases of conflicts or disputes, collaboration for resolution is encouraged. This may involve mediation or other conflict resolution methods to maintain a harmonious community.

5.                   Contributor Benefits:

    While monetary compensation is not provided, contributors receive incentives and rewards such as exclusive event access, community recognition, and opportunities to earn tokens through active participation in the ecosystem.

6.                   Off-boarding:
    A smooth transition during contributor departure is crucial to safeguard the DAO's assets and information. The off-boarding process ensures the collection of necessary information and ties up all loose ends, facilitating a seamless exit.

Involuntary Off-Boarding Process

The Involuntary Off-boarding Process is an essential element of maintaining transparency and fairness within the Unit Network ecosystem.

The Core Team emphasizes the need for contributors to be aware that consistent disruption, lack of attendance/contribution, and negative impacts on Unit Network's progress may lead to their removal from the project.

While this approach may differ from common DAO practices, the Core Team believes in establishing clear rules and consequences. This ensures the smooth operation and progress of the community. The key steps in the Involuntary Off-boarding Process are as follows:

1.      Notification:
    Contributors will be notified if their behavior consistently disrupts the project, and if there is a lack of attendance or contribution.
    Specific examples of the behavior in question will be provided, along with a clear explanation of its detrimental impact on Unit Network's progress.
2.      Warning:
    Following the notification, contributors will receive a warning indicating that they are expected to rectify their behavior within a specified timeframe.
3.      Final Decision:
    If the contributor fails to rectify their behavior within the given timeframe, the Core Team will make a final decision regarding their involvement.
    Potential outcomes include suspension or termination of the contributor's engagement with Unit Network.
4.      Communication:
    The final decision will be communicated to the contributor involved, ensuring transparency and fairness.
    The broader DAO community will also be informed of the decision, maintaining an open and accountable environment within Unit Network.
    In the dynamic landscape of the blockchain industry, characterized by rapid changes and evolving conditions, we actively encourage each member to seize the initiative, assume responsibilities, handpick tasks, and forge their own network within our collective ecosystem.
    Given our decentralized work environment, where we operate remotely and independently towards a shared objective, it is crucial to embody a sense of responsibility and engage with one another in a spirit of respect. We implore you to foster a proactive work culture and embrace an open mindset, recognizing the value of collaboration and individual contributions. Together, let's shape a thriving community that thrives on innovation and collective progress.
