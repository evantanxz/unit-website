# Core Applications

Explore the foundational applications that establish Unit Network as the forefront tokenization platform.

Unit Network is an integrated ecosystem featuring a collection of native Core Apps that synergize to form a robust and all-encompassing application.

While each of these core apps operates as a distinct module or 'pallet' within the Unit Network blockchain (UnitChain), the goal is to present an uncomplicated, user-friendly, and unified platform.

Here, all core apps and features collaborate seamlessly to deliver a familiar and intuitive application experience to the user.
