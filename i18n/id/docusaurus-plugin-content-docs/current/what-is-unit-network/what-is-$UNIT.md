# What is $UNIT

Discover UNIT: Igniting the Future of Token Economy

UNIT, a utility token of fixed supply, finds its roots in the UnitChain – a robust layer 1 blockchain meticulously constructed with Substrate.

This blockchain is purpose-built to seamlessly scale the token economy, offering a foundation for enhanced efficiency and innovation.

UnitChain distinguishes itself as a sovereign blockchain, operating independently from other ecosystems such as Ethereum, Solana, and Cosmos.

This autonomy presents a distinct advantage for the Unit Network platform, translating into heightened scalability, reduced transaction fees, and accelerated performance.

By navigating its own path, UnitChain establishes a resilient infrastructure, empowering the Unit Network to deliver a seamless and cost-effective experience for its users.

## Core Team Token Allocation

A total of 200,000,000 UNIT tokens are designated for distribution among 200 core team members, equating to 1,000,000 UNIT per individual. The distribution follows a structured timeline with specific conditions:

- **Cliff Period:**
  There is a 3-year cliff, during which the tokens remain inaccessible, establishing a vested period before any tokens become available to the core team members.

- **Vesting Period:**
  Following the cliff period, a 5-year vesting schedule is implemented, gradually releasing the allocated tokens to team members over this duration from the start date of signing the Pioneer Cooperation Agreement.

This strategic distribution approach ensures alignment between the interests of core team members and the long-term success and sustainability of the UNIT ecosystem. The vesting period encourages commitment and dedication by tying token accessibility to the team's continued contributions and success over an extended timeframe.

- **Advisor Operational Bonuses:**
  10% of the sale value in UNIT is credited to Advisors as an operational bonus.

This structure incentivizes both Core Team members and Advisors to actively engage in promoting UNIT sales. The operational bonuses are directly tied to the success of their referrals in purchasing UNIT during sale rounds, fostering a collaborative approach to the growth and success of the UNIT ecosystem.
