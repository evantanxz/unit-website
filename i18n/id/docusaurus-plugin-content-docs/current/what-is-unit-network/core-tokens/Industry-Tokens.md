Exploring Use-Cases, Governance, and Tokenomics of Industry Tokens

Revolutionizing Industries: Industry Tokens are open DAOs, uniting individuals, businesses, and communities within the industry. Backed by Blue Chips and a reverse ETF, these tokens enable anyone to buy a single token and participate in the potential upside of a specific territory.

:::tip Industry Tokens Verification:

Unit Foundation has exclusively created all Industry Tokens. To ensure authenticity, check the token manager's username on the Tokens Info page and steer clear of fraudulent tokens.

Industry Tokens serve multiple purposes:

1. **Purchase Power:**
   Used to buy products and services from Industry Token community stores.

2. **Payment Medium:**
   Transferred as payment between users.

3. **Sale:**
   Industry Token Treasuries receive 0.5% of all Industry Token trades.

4. **Transfer:**
   Purchased as a Reserve ETF of all the tokens in a specific industry.

## Empowering Community-Led Governance: Unleashing the Potential of Industry Tokens on Unit Network

All members of the Unit Network core team actively participate in at least one Industry Token DAO, contributing to the setup, management, and maintaining direct communication with the community.

As part of the long-term vision, the responsibility for Industry Token bank and treasury management will gradually transition to specific core team members dedicated to building and moderating Industry Token communities.

This approach aims to customize governance and objectives according to the unique needs of each community.

## A Unified Approach to Tokenomics for Diverse Ventures

All Industry Tokens crafted by Unit Foundation adhere to a unified tokenomic structure, outlined as follows:

- **Contract:** UnitChain
- **Total Supply:** 100,000,000.0 (100%)
- **Sale Supply:** 66,000,000.00 (66%)
- **Operations:** 14,000,000.00 (14%)
- **Core Team:** 20,000,000.00 (20%) (Distributed among 200 individuals with a 3-year cliff and 5-year vesting period)

## Resilient Backing, Sustainable Growth: Backed by Blue Chips, Industry Tokens Ensure Value and Minimize Risk.

Similar to the UNIT Coin, every Industry Token from Unit Foundation is secured by Blue Chips.

A substantial 90% of Industry Token sales are locked in the treasury, fortifying value and reducing downside risks.
