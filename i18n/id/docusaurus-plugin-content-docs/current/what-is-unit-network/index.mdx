# What is Unit Network?

Unit Network: Pioneering a New Era of Token-Based Economy

Unit Network pioneers a new era of the token-based economy, serving as both a protocol and application. It connects communities, projects, businesses, real-world assets, and network states in an open financial network.

Accessible worldwide, Unit Network thrives on inclusivity, offering a peer-to-peer and interoperable financial infrastructure.

The decentralized protocol aims to create a more equitable financial system, providing purpose-built tools and applications that reject discrimination and enable universal participation in the potential growth of people, projects, and businesses.

Unit Network goes beyond digital currency, allowing users to tokenize tangible assets like music, real estate, infrastructure, intellectual property, and more.

The platform facilitates the secure representation, trading, and digitization of diverse assets, ushering in an era of flexibility and innovation.

In the realm of the Internet of Value, Unit Network disrupts the norm of surrendering control and access to personal data for 'free' internet services.

With decentralized applications and tools prioritizing user control, opening an account is free, easy, entirely within the user's control, and doesn't collect personal information. This ensures an internet of value experience without compromising privacy.
