# What is a token?

Navigating the World of Digital Assets and Diverse Applications

At its core, a token serves as a medium for transactions within a digital ecosystem. The idea of non-physical currency, whether in the form of tokens or coins, might be perplexing to many. However, with the advent of blockchain technology, the creation and transfer of value through innovative means have entered mainstream discussions.

Historically, generating a token was a costly and intricate process, requiring expertise in blockchain development or a dedicated team. In recent years, this landscape has evolved, thanks to protocols like Ethereum, Solana, and Cosmos. These platforms empower users to launch their smart contracts, tokens, or NFTs seamlessly on top of their blockchains.
