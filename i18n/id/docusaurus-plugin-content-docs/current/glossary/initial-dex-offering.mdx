# Initial DEX (Decentralised Exchange) Offering

An Initial DEX (Decentralised Exchange) Offering, commonly abbreviated as IDO, is a type of cryptocurrency token offering conducted on a Decentralised Exchange (DEX). Unlike traditional Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) that often take place on centralized platforms, IDOs are carried out in a decentralized manner.

In an IDO, users have the opportunity to lock funds, usually in the form of a well-established cryptocurrency like Ethereum (ETH), in exchange for newly issued tokens during the token generation event. These tokens are often associated with a specific decentralized project or platform. The funds collected from participants are then used to support the development and growth of the project.

One distinctive feature of IDOs is the role played by decentralized exchanges, which facilitate the token sale and contribute to liquidity post-sale. The process typically involves users providing liquidity by adding the new tokens to a Liquidity Pool (LP) on the decentralized exchange. The LP tokens obtained in return can be staked or used for other purposes within the ecosystem.

IDO participants aim to acquire new tokens at an early stage, with the potential for future appreciation in value. The decentralized nature of IDOs aligns with the broader ethos of blockchain and cryptocurrency communities, emphasizing peer-to-peer transactions and reducing reliance on centralized intermediaries.
