# Decentralised Community Token (DCT)

A Decentralised Community Token (DCT) is a type of token that represents the next evolution in the Web3 ecosystem. DCTs are a concept that follows on from Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).

The term implies that the token is associated with a decentralized community, often formed around a specific project, platform, or organization. These tokens are typically distributed through community-driven initiatives and can serve various purposes within the ecosystem. DCTs often involve community governance, allowing token holders to participate in decision-making processes related to the development and direction of the associated project.

In summary, a Decentralised Community Token is a digital asset linked to a decentralized community, emphasizing community involvement, governance, and participation in the evolution of the associated ecosystem.
