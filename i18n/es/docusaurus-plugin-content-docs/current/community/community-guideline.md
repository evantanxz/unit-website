Unit Network Community: Where Respect, Collaboration, and Innovation Unite.

Unit Network prioritizes inclusivity, welcoming individuals of all backgrounds. Regardless of age, gender identity, race, sexual orientation, physical ability, religion, ethnicity, or perspective, everyone is encouraged to participate. As the chats are public spaces, it's essential to use respectful language, and any personal issues should be discussed privately or outside the platform.

:::warning Note:

In Unit Network chats, requesting crypto/deposits is strictly prohibited. If anyone, even someone claiming to be a Unit team member, asks for anything, report it immediately for removal and blocking. Be cautious of scammers impersonating others; check TG handles and inform an admin if necessary. Stay vigilant to maintain a secure environment.
