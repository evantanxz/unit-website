# What is Web3 ?

Unlocking the Decentralized Future of the Internet

### The Evolution of the Internet

The centralization of the internet played a pivotal role in introducing billions of users to the World Wide Web, establishing a resilient foundation for its growth. However, this centralization also ushered in a scenario where a handful of dominant entities held considerable control over the web, wielding unilateral authority over content and connectivity.

Enter Web3, heralding a transformative paradigm in the digital landscape. This new era of the internet signifies a departure from the dominance of major tech corporations, advocating for a decentralized model. Web3 is not merely a technological evolution but a cultural shift where the creation, management, and ownership of the internet are driven by its users, redistributing power from corporations to individuals. To fully grasp the significance of Web3, it is essential to trace the journey that brought us to this transformative juncture.

### Unveiling the Early Internet

While the internet has seamlessly integrated into modern life, its present form is the outcome of a profound evolution from its initial conception. Understanding these transformative phases necessitates categorizing the internet's concise history into two distinct eras: Web 1.0 and Web 2.0.

### Web 1.0: Read-Only (1990-2004)

In the corridors of CERN in Geneva in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee laid the foundation for the World Wide Web, envisioning open and decentralized protocols to facilitate global information sharing.
The inaugural phase of Berners-Lee's pioneering project, later dubbed 'Web 1.0,' spanned from approximately 1990 to 2004. This era was characterized by predominantly static websites under the control of corporations, offering limited user interaction. Individuals rarely contributed content, earning this period the moniker of the read-only web.

### Web 2.0: Read-Write (2004-now)

The inception of Web 2.0, around 2004, marked a pivotal moment with the ascendance of social media platforms, transforming the internet from a predominantly read-only medium to an interactive read-write experience. This era witnessed a paradigm shift as companies transitioned from merely delivering content to users to providing platforms for user-generated content and meaningful interactions.
With the surge in internet usage, a few dominant companies emerged, wielding substantial control over online traffic and value creation. The introduction of the advertising-based revenue model characterized Web 2.0, enabling users to create content but lacking ownership and direct financial benefits from its monetization.

### Web 3.0: Read-Write-Own

The visionary concept of 'Web 3.0' was introduced by Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum and subsequently the founder of Polkadot, in the aftermath of Ethereum's launch in 2014. Gavin addressed a shared concern among early crypto enthusiasts â€“ the overreliance on trust in the existing Web.
In essence, the prevalent version of the Web, familiar to contemporary users, hinges on placing trust in a limited number of private corporations to prioritize the public good.

### Empowering True Ownership: The Dawn of Web3

The New World of Web3 Web3 has become an encompassing term representing the vision of a new and improved internet of value. At its core, Web3 utilizes blockchains, cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and smart contracts to empower users with true ownership. While Web1 was read-only, and Web2 is read-write, Web3 aspires to be read-write-own.

#### Why is Web3 Important?

While not all features of Web3 are fully discovered or implemented, several key concepts support understanding its importance in the emergent token economy.

#### Core Principles of Web3

Defining Web3 can be intricate, but it is guided by fundamental principles:

1. Decentralization: Web3 stands out for its decentralized nature, distributing ownership among developers and users, in contrast to the centralized control seen in many parts of the internet.
2. Permissionless Access: Web3 ensures universal accessibility, allowing everyone to engage without exclusion, promoting equal participation.
3. Native Payments: Integrating cryptocurrencies for online transactions, Web3 moves away from traditional reliance on banking systems and payment processors.
4. Trustless Environment: Web3 operates without depending on trusted intermediaries, relying on a system of incentives and economic models for a trustless operational framework.

#### Ownership

Web3 revolutionizes digital asset ownership, offering true ownership through digital tokens. In contrast to Web2, where in-game items are tied exclusively to user accounts, Web3 allows genuine ownership rights that persist even if users decide to quit playing, enabling them to sell or exchange in-game items on open markets.

#### Censorship Resistance

Unlike Web2 platforms where content creators are vulnerable to platform policies, Web3 platforms resist censorship. The OnlyFans incident highlights the risks creators face in Web2, whereas Web3 empowers creators to maintain ownership and resist unilateral platform decisions.

#### Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)

Web3 introduces DAOs, allowing users not only to own their data but also to collectively own and influence the platform's future. DAOs, built on smart contracts, enable decentralized decision-making and resource allocation by token holders.

#### Identity

Web3 challenges the traditional approach to user accounts on different platforms by providing a more streamlined process and mitigating censorship risks associated with social sign-ins.

#### Native Payments

Web3 employs tokens like UNIT for direct money transfers within a browser, eliminating the need for traditional banking institutions and payment processors.

#### How Can We Improve Web3?

Despite its benefits, Web3 has limitations that the Unit Network DAO is addressing:

1. Improved Accessibility: Web3 features, including Unit Network registration, are available at no cost. Efforts are made to enhance accessibility for individuals in less-wealthy nations through comprehensive documentation, educational programs, and open technology.
2. Simple User Experience: Unit Network integrates Web2 UI/UX with blockchain security, removing technical barriers and allowing users to focus on community building and project development.
3. Education & Learning Resources: Web3 introduces new paradigms requiring different mental models than Web2.0. Educational initiatives, such as the free Unit Masters program, aim to inform Web2 users about Web3 paradigms.

#### A Decentralized Future

Web3 is a young and evolving ecosystem that has gained considerable interest in recent times. With advancements in cryptocurrency, layer 2 scaling solutions, governance experiments, and digital identity revolutions, the future of the Web looks promising as we continue to improve the supporting infrastructure for Web3."
