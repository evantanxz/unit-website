The Team tab publicly showcases tokens in which you hold a team membership. Token creators have the capability to add users as team members, specifying token allocations, and providing options for cliff and vesting periods. This feature distinguishes team membership from token holding, allowing creators to incentivize core team participation in project development.

Within the Team Panel, you will see the list of your team members.
