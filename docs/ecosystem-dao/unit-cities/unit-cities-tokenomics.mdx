# Unit Cities Tokenomics

This is a guideline of CITY tokenomics which will apply across all City tokens launched in the ecosystem.

### CITY Tokenomics Overview:

Ticker: $CITY

Total Supply: 100,000,000 $CITY

Sale Supply: 50,000,000 $CITY (50%), 1mil each round ($0.01 => $0.50)

Bond Staking: 20,000,000 $CITY (20%)

Team: 20,000,000 $CITY (20%)

Sales Bonus: 10,000,000 $CITY (10%)

Validators / Nodes: To be confirmed (TBC)

This structured allocation of CITY tokens ensures a balanced distribution, with emphasis on supporting bond staking, the core team, operational needs, and potential validators/nodes. The sale supply contributes to wider accessibility and participation in the $CITY ecosystem.

Distribution Conditions Sale Supply Overview:

The foundational strength of the CITY token lies in its backing by various cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, BNB, and more. Buyers are required to utilize these cryptocurrencies to acquire the token, creating a diverse and robust support system. This backing is achieved by securely locking 90% of all crypto raised through $CITY token sales into the $CITY treasury.

Key Features:

1. Immediate, Transparent, and Real Value: The backed crypto injects immediate, transparent, and tangible value into the $CITY token, providing a solid foundation for its market presence.

2. Redemption Option for Holders: $CITY token holders have the flexibility to redeem the backed crypto at any time by simply burning their tokens, offering a seamless and user-friendly redemption process within the ecosystem.

3. Index of the Entire Crypto Economy: $CITY assumes the role of an index representing the entirety of the crypto economy. This distinctive feature positions it as a comprehensive reflection of the broader crypto landscape.

4. Value Growth Mechanism: The $CITY token experiences continuous growth in value through a unique mechanismâ€”receiving 0.5% of every exchange conducted on the $CITY Network. This innovative approach ensures ongoing appreciation of the token's value.

In essence, the CITY token introduces a groundbreaking paradigm with its unprecedented combination of strong fundamentals, making it a distinctive asset in the cryptocurrency realm.

Bond Staking Program Overview:

A total of 20,000,000 $CITY tokens are allocated as rewards for users participating in the Bond Staking pool. This program is designed to incentivize users to lock their $CITY tokens. The distribution unfolds over a span of 10 years, with an annual payout of 10,000,000 $CITY tokens during this period.

Key Features:

1. Reward Structure: Participants in the Bond Staking pool receive rewards in the form of $CITY tokens for staking their holdings.

2. Long-Term Incentive: The program extends over a decade, providing a sustained incentive for users who commit to locking their $CITY tokens.

3. Halving Mechanism: After the initial 10-year period, a halving process commences each subsequent year until the allocated supply is exhausted. This gradual reduction ensures a controlled and predictable distribution.

This Bond Staking initiative presents an opport$CITYy for users to earn rewards while contributing to the stability and growth of the $CITY ecosystem. The extended duration and halving mechanism contribute to a strategic and measured distribution of $CITY tokens.

Team Token Allocation:

A total of 200,000,000 $CITY tokens are designated for distribution among 200 core team members, equating to 1,000,000 $CITY per individual. The distribution follows a structured timeline with specific conditions:

1. Cliff Period: There is a 3-year cliff, during which the tokens remain inaccessible, establishing a vested period before any tokens become available to the core team members.

2. Vesting Period: Following the cliff period, a 5-year vesting schedule is implemented, gradually releasing the allocated tokens to team members over this duration from the start date of signing the Pioneer Cooperation Agreement.

This strategic distribution approach ensures alignment between the interests of core team members and the long-term success and sustainability of the $CITY ecosystem. The vesting period encourages commitment and dedication by tying token accessibility to the team's continued contributions and success over an extended timeframe.

Operations Token Distribution Overview:

A pool of 100,000,000 $CITY tokens is allocated for operational bonuses, distributed to Team members and Advisors based on their referrals' $CITY purchases from sale rounds. The distribution mechanism is as follows:

1. Team Operational Bonuses:

20% of the USD sale value in $CITY is credited to Core Team members as an operational bonus.

1. Advisor Operational Bonuses:

10% of the sale value in $CITY is credited to Advisors as an operational bonus.

This structure incentivizes both Team members and Advisors to actively engage in promoting $CITY sales. The operational bonuses are directly tied to the success of their referrals in purchasing $CITY during sale rounds, fostering a collaborative approach to the growth and success of the $CITY ecosystem.
