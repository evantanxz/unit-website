Unlocking the Potential: Navigating Unit Network City Tokens – From Usage and Governance to Tokenomics

Every City Token operates as an inclusive DAO, uniting individuals, businesses, and communities within the city.

It doubles as a currency supported by Blue Chips and functions as a reverse ETF, enabling individuals to purchase a single token and participate in the potential growth of a specific territory.

> Unit Foundation has exclusively created all Industry Tokens. To ensure authenticity, check the token manager's username on the Tokens Info page and steer clear of fraudulent tokens.

City Tokens serve various purposes, including:

1. Utilized for purchasing products and services at community stores within the City Token ecosystem.
2. Transferred as a means of payment between users.
3. City Token Treasuries receive 0.5% of all trades involving City Tokens.
4. Acquired as a Reserve ETF representing all tokens within a specific city.

## Empowering Community-Led Governance: Unleashing the Potential of City Tokens on Unit Network

Every member of the Unit Network core team actively participates in at least one City Token DAO, contributing to setup, management, and establishing direct communication channels with the community.

The responsibility for City Token bank and treasury management will eventually transition to specific core team members dedicated to building and moderating City Token communities.

This ensures governance and objectives are customized to meet the unique needs of each community.

## A Unified Approach to Tokenomics for City Tokens

All City Tokens crafted by Unit Foundation adhere to a unified tokenomic structure, details available here:

## Resilient Backing, Sustainable Growth: Backed by Blue Chips, City Tokens Ensure Value and Minimize Risk.

Similar to the UNIT Coin, every City Token from Unit Foundation is secured by Blue Chips.

A substantial 90% of City Token sales are locked in the treasury, fortifying value and reducing downside risks.

Moreover, City Token Treasuries receive a 0.5% share from all trades, enhancing value sustainability.

## Exploring and Elevating Cities Globally.

City Tokens: Presently engaged in approximately 30 cities spanning Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and the Americas.

Our ambitious objective is to extend our footprint and contribute to local economies in 60-70 cities across Asia, 30 cities in the Middle East and Africa, and 50 cities each in Europe and the Americas.
