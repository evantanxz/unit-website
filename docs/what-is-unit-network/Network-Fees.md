# Network Fees

Efficient and Transparent Network Fees for Accessing Core App Features

Network fees constitute a crucial aspect of decentralized protocols, and Unit Network is no exception to this paradigm.

What sets us apart from other decentralized exchanges is our distinctive approach: we apply a transparent flat fee structure for all exchanges and withdrawals.

Notably, our commitment to user-friendly interactions is underscored by the absence of costs or commissions for essential actions such as transfers, stake/unstake processes, or bond staking.

This strategic differentiation aims to provide users with a clear and predictable fee framework, enhancing overall accessibility and fostering a seamless experience within the Unit Network ecosystem.

### Exchange Fee

Every trade conducted on the Unit Network is subject to a 2% fee, distributed equally across four channels:

- 0.5% directed to the UNIT Treasury
- 0.5% allocated to the user responsible for inviting the exchanger
- 0.5% contributed to the liquidity pool
- 0.5% allocated to the Treasury of the specific token being exchanged. This equitable distribution ensures a fair and transparent allocation of fees, benefitting the overall ecosystem and its participants.

### Withdrawal Fee

For each withdrawal on the Unit Network, a 1% withdrawal fee is applied, evenly divided between two components:

- 0.5% directed to the UNIT Treasury
- 0.5% allocated to the Vault responsible for processing the withdrawal.
  This balanced distribution ensures a proportional allocation of withdrawal fees, contributing to the sustainability and functionality of the Unit Network ecosystem.
