# Revenue Model

Unit Network operates on a unique and sustainable revenue model, ensuring community engagement and the continuous development of the platform. Here's how it works:

#### Exchange Fee: 2%

A 2% fee is charged on every exchange transaction within the Unit Network.

#### Distribution of the Fee:

The 2% fee is evenly distributed into four distinct parts, each serving a specific purpose:

#### Unit Treasury allocation: 0.5%

A portion, 0.5%, is directed to the UNIT Treasury. This fund serves as a transparent and immutable reservoir of value within the Unit Network ecosystem.

#### Referrer reward allocation : 0.5%

0.5% is awarded to the user who referred the exchanger. This incentivizes users to refer others, contributing to the network's growth.

#### Liquidity Pool allocation : 0.5%

0.5% of the fee is allocated to the liquidity pool. This ensures a healthy and robust liquidity environment within the network, enhancing the overall trading experience.

#### Token Treasury allocation : 0.5%

0.5% is contributed to the Treasury of the token being exchanged. This supports the specific token's ecosystem, fostering sustainability and development.

#### ​Incentivizing Community Participation:

- The revenue model is designed to encourage active community participation. Users referring others are rewarded, and various components of the network, including the UNIT Treasury and token-specific Treasuries, receive consistent contributions.

#### Sustainability and Growth:

- By distributing the exchange fee across different aspects of the ecosystem, Unit Network ensures a steady flow of resources to critical areas. This sustainable approach supports ongoing development, innovation, and the overall growth of the platform.

In summary, Unit Network's revenue model is not only transparent but also aligns with the principles of community engagement and decentralized sustainability. The even distribution of fees across various segments ensures that each part of the network receives its share, contributing to the ecosystem's resilience and continual advancement.

### Unit Network: Engineered for Purpose, Sovereign by Design – Redefining Blockchain Excellence.

Unit Network distinguishes itself as a purpose-built and sovereign blockchain, setting it apart from major players like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Here are key features that highlight its uniqueness:

1. Application-Specific Blockchain:

- Unit Network is tailored for specific applications, providing a focused and efficient environment for various use cases. Unlike general-purpose blockchains, it is designed with specific functionalities in mind.

2. Proof-of-Stake Model:

- The platform utilizes a proof-of-stake consensus model, enhancing energy efficiency compared to the energy-intensive proof-of-work model employed by Bitcoin. This contributes to a more sustainable and eco-friendly blockchain ecosystem.

3. Transaction Speeds:

- With its proof-of-stake model, Unit Network potentially offers faster transaction speeds. This is a significant advantage, particularly in scenarios where quick and efficient transactions are essential.

4. Minimal Fee Structure:

- Unit Network features a minimal fee structure, providing a cost-effective solution for users. This stands in contrast to higher transaction fees often associated with Bitcoin and Ethereum, especially during periods of high network congestion.

5. Cost-Effective and Scalable:

- The minimal fee structure, combined with the platform's design, makes Unit Network a cost-effective and scalable choice for specific blockchain applications. This can lead to more efficient and economical transactions for users.

Unit Network's purpose-built nature, proof-of-stake consensus, and minimal fee structure contribute to its efficiency, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, platforms like Unit Network offer tailored solutions to meet the diverse needs of specific applications and industries.

### Unit Network: Pioneering a New Business Frontier with Innovation, Sustainability, and Community Empowerment at its Core.

The Patreon business model serves as a valuable benchmark for market pricing, particularly in the artist-focused niche, with over 200,000 projects funded by supporters. Patreon charges a 5-12% fee for its services.

In stark contrast, Unit Network introduces a disruptive pricing approach. For projects raising capital, there are no fees, and on exchanges, a modest 2% fee is charged, borne by the buyer, not the seller. In fact, sellers receive 0.5% on the sale.

This groundbreaking pricing model enables agencies to offer highly competitive fees and percentages. It allows for the extra time, care, hand-holding, administration, and management necessary to craft customized and powerful tokenization models effectively. Unit Network's approach reshapes the landscape, fostering affordability, accessibility, and innovation in the realm of tokenization.

### Navigating the Future: The Index of RWAs & DeFi - Bridging Traditional Assets with Decentralized Finance Innovation.

Unit Network's revenue model stands out for its distinct 2% fee distribution, gaining additional strength from the robust backing of the UNIT token treasury.

This treasury is uniquely fortified with a diverse portfolio of blue-chip crypto assets, strategically utilized in the minting of UNIT.

This composition not only enhances the treasury's anti-fragility but also ensures its continuous growth in resilience and value with every transaction conducted within the network.

In an unintended yet significant consequence, the UNIT token transcends its role as a mere transactional unit. Instead, it evolves into a dynamic index, reflecting the entirety of the token economy.

This perpetual backing by the escalating value of esteemed assets such as BTC, ETH, DOT, and various other blue-chip holdings positions the UNIT token as a pivotal and influential element within the broader crypto ecosystem.

It symbolizes not just a unit of exchange but a tangible representation of the evolving trends and values shaping the dynamic landscape of cryptocurrencies.
