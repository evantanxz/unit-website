# What is $UNIT

Discover UNIT: Igniting the Future of Token Economy

UNIT, a utility token of fixed supply, finds its roots in the UnitChain â€“ a robust layer 1 blockchain meticulously constructed with Substrate.

This blockchain is purpose-built to seamlessly scale the token economy, offering a foundation for enhanced efficiency and innovation.

UnitChain distinguishes itself as a sovereign blockchain, operating independently from other ecosystems such as Ethereum, Solana, and Cosmos.

This autonomy presents a distinct advantage for the Unit Network platform, translating into heightened scalability, reduced transaction fees, and accelerated performance.

By navigating its own path, UnitChain establishes a resilient infrastructure, empowering the Unit Network to deliver a seamless and cost-effective experience for its users.
